title: Week 4 ( 26 June - 3 July )
---

I survived the Third week of CS 373: Software engineering!!

What did I do this Past Week :

On Monday we have our first exam. The exam was online through canvas. The exam was within reach but somehow confusing. There was enough time for the exam but the downside is taae tryping takes longer than just simply writing by hand. On Wednesday, two UT alumni's who work for Pariveda came to give a talk.
The goal was the talk was to inform and educate us about what Pariveda is and what it does. The taling was interesting with full of great advices. After the talk, Professor Downing stop about our third programming assignmnent. Our third assignment involves creating a Web app hosted on Digital Ocean that emulates IMDB to track something. This assignment will actually be done in three phases.

What's in my way :
My group and I started workig on the project but a challenge is having to work with Five other students. I find it more convenient to work with fewer people because when dealing with several students, it quite hard to get a hold of everybody. I guess that is good practice of how it feels like to work on a real project in a company.

What I will do next week :

Next week, I will start working on the second phase of our big project early. I will try to make sure that everybody in the group is on track so that we can finish the project in a timely manner. I will also try to know more of my classmates. In addition, I will try my best to be more focused in class and participate more oftenly.

Tip-Of-The-Week :

My tip for the week is to make sure you improve on your interpersonal communication skills. It is a very important sill to possess.
On to week 5!!!!!
