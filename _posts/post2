title: Week 2 ( 13 June - 19 June )
---

I survived the Second week of CS 373: Software engineering!!

What did I do this Past Week :

Last week we learned about iteration and the Professor spent a lot of time explaining our secong programming assignment. I actually enjoy the second assignment betterthan the first.In the second Project we have to predict netflix's movie ratings. So far I like the dynamic of the class. Last week my quiz grades dropped a little bit, so I have to ensure that I study harder inorder to get higher grades. To have a good grade in the quizes, you have to read the assigned book chapters and review what was done during the previous lecture. Our first Programming assignment is due next week tuesday and Professor Downing took about 40 minutes during one of the lectures to explain the project in detail to us. This was very helpful because it gave me a good idea of what I was expected to do.

What's in my way :

Currently I will say that I am doing okay in the class and I am not falling behind. This is because I study at least for 2hours everyday. I would have loved to put in more time but I am taking two other summer classes in addition to cs 373. I am taking computer security and I am doing an independent research(cs 370) with Professor Gouda. I hope my grades continue to be good in this class.

What I will do next week :

Next week I will finish up with Project 1 and go to the lab session on monday to ask for clarifications on the project. I will also read the assigned chapters since some quiz questions come from there.

Pick-Of-The-Week :

Learning about github pages and jekyll was my pick-of-the-week. It was very intresting to read about it learn how it works. I will definitely recommend it to others.
