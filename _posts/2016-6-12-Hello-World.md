I survived the first week of CS 373: Software engineering!!

Professor Downing is by far one of the best Professor . He definitely knows what he is talking about. On the first day of class we simply went over the class syllabus and we started working on hello.py. So far I like the dynamic of the class. He has a google doc where he write down all the main points and it is really helpful because you dont need to write it down because you will have access to it after. Also electronic devices are not allowed in his class; I think this is to help the students focus on what he is teaching. We have short quizes during the start of every lecture. I did not do well on the first quiz but I got good scores on the other ones. To have a good grade in the quizes, you have to read the assigned book chapters and review what we did during the previous lecture. Our first Programming assignment is next week tuesday and Professor Downing took about 40 minutes during one of the lectures to explain the project in detail to us. This was very helpful because it gave us a good idea of what we are expected to do.

My first week in software engineering was great.
