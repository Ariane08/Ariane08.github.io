title: Week 3 ( 20 June - 26 June )
---

I survived the Third week of CS 373: Software engineering!!

What did I do this Past Week :

My partner and I were able to submit our lab 2 on time and we got our rmse to be less than 1. Last week we learned a lot of new material, for example we laerned about callables, iterables,and functions in python. We also learned how to write the class and method for range and rangeIterator. Professor Downing made us pairup inoder to write the code for rangeIterator and range. I really like working on those exercises with a partner rather than by myself. This is because, two minds are better than just one. In addition you learn from each other                       
What's in my way :

We have our firt midterm this upcoming monday and I have been studying hard for it but I wished professor Downing had provided us with some practice exams. This would have helped me know exactly what to expect and feel more prepared.
What I will do next week :

Next week, I will start working on the 3rd project early. I will also try to know more of my classmates. In addition I will try my best to be more focused in class and participate more oftenly.
Tip-Of-The-Week :

Study for exams with a partner. You will undestand the material better and you will both learn from one another.

On to week 4!!!!!
